## Afraid of not being up to date?

You won't be anymore after installing this app thanks to push notifications for Android. When one of Daily Nintendo's writers has something important for you to read you can expect a push notification very soon to let you know about this.

The app will always be free for anyone to download and will never display any more advertisements than the website. You will never be punished for using the convinience of an app.
